This corpus was put together by taking 13 Russian novels and stories by 11 authors: Gogol, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Gertsen, Karamzin, Kologrivova, Kovalevskaya, Rostopchina, and Xvoschinskaya. Each text was transcribed and had word boundaries and punctuation marks removed by script, and then all the texts were combined into one file. Attention was paid to the function vs. lexical status of the orthographic in the transcription process, but there may still be mistakes in the resulting corpus due to its sheer size.
