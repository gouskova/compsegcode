The Ngbaka simulation is described in the paper. <br>
The corpus is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/dictionnaire-ngbaka-franais/oclc/930041468&referer=brief_results">Henrix's (2015) Ngbaka-French dictionary</a> and comprises 5,571 distinct lexical items.  The dictionary was hand-entered into a text file; tones are not transcribed, but lexical items differing in tone alone are not collapsed into a single entry.  Further description of the language can be found at the beginning of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/dictionnaire-ngbaka-francais-neerlandais-prec-dun-apercu-grammatical/oclc/251249793&referer=brief_results">Maes's (1959) dictionary</a>.  <br> Note that the variety of Ngbaka discussed and analyzed in this paper is distinct from Ngbaka Ma'bo, the language described by <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/le-parler-ngbaka-de-bokanga-phonologie-morphologie-syntaxe/oclc/123582235&referer=brief_results">Thomas (1963)</a> and analyzed by <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/15106">Sagey (1986)</a> (among many others).
