The new feature file is well-formed. all the segments can be uniquely identified.

Found complex segments on iteration 1:
t ʃʰ	1.5381168167547232
t sʰ	1.0432149184693313
t ʃ	1.0016975446519567

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


ʃʰ  has a subset of the features of tʃʰ
sʰ  has a subset of the features of tsʰ

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.

Wrote modified learning data to /iteration1/LearningData.txt

Your segments are all defined in the feature file.
