Mongolian is not in the paper. The language is described by Svantesson et al. (2005, Phonology of Mongolian) as having the affricates [ts], [tsʰ], [tʃ], [tʃʰ]. It furthermore has a palatalization and an aspiration contrast for most of its obstruents, neither of which we not tackle here.<br> 
The learner was trained on an An Crúbadán corpus, transcribed from Cyrillic according to Svantesson et al. (See <a href="https://github.com/gouskova/transcribers/tree/master/mongolian">here</a>). The learner does pretty well on this corpus, even though it is not the best data source: it identifies all affricates but the plain [ts].
