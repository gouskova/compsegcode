Wargamay is described by Dixon (1981). Dixon is the only source on Wargamay, and he does not posit complex segments for the language. But he does mention a few suggestive facts:
<li>Voiced stop-initial morphemes sporadically appear with prothetic nasals, e.g., /gubi-bulu/ --> [gubimbulu] 'wise man'.</li>
<li>NC clusters do not have to be homorganic, but homorganic ones are four times more common than non-homorganic ones (Dixon 1981:23).</li>
<br>
The learner's outcome in this case is similar to Sundanese: it identifies homorganic nasal-stop clusters as complex segments. From the point of view of distribution, NC clusters are inseparable. Thus, just as in Sundanese, this could be a learning-theoretic argument for a complex segment analysis.
