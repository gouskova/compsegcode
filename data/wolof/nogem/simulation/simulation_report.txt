Found complex segments on iteration 1:
ɴ q	3.667552169801078

k k	1.0410038616817048

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


p  has a subset of the features of pp
k  has a subset of the features of kk
q  has a subset of the features of ɴq

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.
