Yindjibarndi, a language not discussed in our paper, is described by <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/yindjibarndi-language/oclc/480759954&referer=brief_results">Wordick (1982)</a>.  Wordick does not posit an inventory containing any complex segments, although fn. 3 on p. 40 suggests that the language may have a series of prenasalized stops: a speaker, when asked to divide <em>multi</em> into syllables, provided <em>mu.nti</em>. <br> Our corpus is a hand-entered version of each headword provided in Wordick's lexicon; the short version contains all of the 1-2 syllable forms from that lexicon.  In both cases, the learner's reaction to the Yindjibarndi data is similar to its reaction to the Quechua word corpus: it unifies all clusters in the data whose frequency is significantly different from 0. <br>
We suspect that two factors lead to this result.  First, Yindjibarndi consonantal phonotactics are quite restrictive: clusters appear only between vowels, and are limited in their composition (see Wordick).  Second, Wordick's lexicon is small and includes a large number of morphologically complex forms.  Unfortunately it is not easy to see whether or not the results would change given a different corpus, because Wordick's lexicon is the only one that we are aware of.  Yindjibarndi thus stands as a difficult case for our learner.
