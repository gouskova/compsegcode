The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


w  has a subset of the features of rrw
r  has a subset of the features of rp
r  has a subset of the features of rk
ngk  has a subset of the features of nk
ngk  has a subset of the features of rnk
nk  has a subset of the features of rnk
rp  has a subset of the features of rk

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.
