</p>The corpus of French infant-directed speech comes from <a href="https://childes.talkbank.org/derived/frenchphon.zip">CHILDES</a>, and was prepared by <a href="https://github.com/juliacarbajal/french_phonologizer">Maria Julia Carbajal, Camillia Bouchon, Emmanuel Dupoux, & Sharon Peperkamp (2018)</a>. We used their IPA correspondence table to transcribe the files. Since the corpus consists of utterances rather than words, we split the utterances on commas, exclamation marks,
question marks, and "unintelligible"
signs, so each connected utterance appears without word breaks on its own line. This is the version of the data where token rather than type frequencies are represented, i.e., the word "ty" appears multiple times and not just once.</p>

<p>The Quebecois variant was generated by substituting all occurrences of [t] and [d] before [i, y] with [t s] and [d z], respectively.</p>
