</p>The corpus of French infant-directed speech comes from <a href="https://childes.talkbank.org/derived/frenchphon.zip">CHILDES</a>, and was prepared by <a href="https://github.com/juliacarbajal/french_phonologizer">Maria Julia Carbajal, Camillia Bouchon, Emmanuel Dupoux, & Sharon Peperkamp (2018)</a>. We used their IPA correspondence table to transcribe the files. 
This is the version of the data tokenized by word, so only <b>type</b> frequencies are represented, i.e., the word "ty" appears just once in the data instead of multiple times.</p>

<p>The Quebecois variant was generated by substituting all occurrences of [t] and [d] before [i, y] with [t s] and [d z], respectively.</p>
