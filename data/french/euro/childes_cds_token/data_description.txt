The corpus of French infant-directed speech comes from <a href="https://childes.talkbank.org/derived/frenchphon.zip">CHILDES</a>, and was prepared by <a href="https://github.com/juliacarbajal/french_phonologizer">Maria Julia Carbajal, Camillia Bouchon, Emmanuel Dupoux, & Sharon Peperkamp (2018)</a>. We used their IPA correspondence table to transcribe the files. Since the corpus consists of utterances rather than words, we split the utterances on commas, exclamation marks,
question marks, and "unintelligible"
signs, so each connected utterance appears without word breaks on its own line. The corpus represents <b>token frequencies</b> rather than type frequencies; i.e., the word "ty" (you) would appear multiple times in connected speech.
