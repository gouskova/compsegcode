Turkish is described in the paper along with Hebrew, as one of the relatively straightforward cases from the point of view of phonotactic arguments for complex segments. There is only one thing to add here: etymologically, the voiced [d í] is foreign in Turkish. Grammars often mention that this sound occurs in loans from Arabic, Persian, and European languages--as well as a few native ideophones. It is likely that native speakers are not aware of the sound being etymologically foreign, and it
is sufficiently well-established that our learner identifies it on the first iteration.
