The new feature file is well-formed. all the segments can be uniquely identified.

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


ʃ'  has a subset of the features of tʃ'
s'  has a subset of the features of ts'

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.

The following segments are in the feature file but are not in the data file, and will be removed from feature file:
