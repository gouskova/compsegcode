The new feature file is well-formed. all the segments can be uniquely identified.

Found complex segments on iteration 1:
t s'	1.6667929478001147
d ʒ	1.3568125153647783

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


s'  has a subset of the features of ts'

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.

Wrote modified learning data to /iteration1/LearningData.txt

The following segments are in the feature file but are not in the data file, and will be removed from feature file:
a:N aN e:N eN i:N iN o:N oN s'

No complex segments identified in LearningData.txt. That is the final version of your learning data.
