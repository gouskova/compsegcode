The new feature file is well-formed. all the segments can be uniquely identified.

Found complex segments on iteration 1:
c ʃ'	9.106297148671453
ɟ ʒ	8.943847608234657
t s'	3.283165035418899
t ɬ'	2.579629670686278

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


ʃ'  has a subset of the features of cʃ'
s'  has a subset of the features of ts'

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.
