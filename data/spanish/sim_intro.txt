Spanish is not in the paper. This pair of simulations shows how big a difference transcriptions can make. While the learner has no difficulty identifying the uncontroversial affricate of Spanish, [tʃ], it also sometimes finds other things, depending on how the data are transcribed. The dataset comes from <a href="http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm">this site</a> and was converted into IPA according to descriptions of (approximately) Mexican Spanish. There are two versions of the data: one reflects the complementary distribution of [β ð ɣ] and [b d g], and the other transcribes all voiced obstruents as [b d g]. In the "narrow transcription" version, with spirants, the voiced stops occur
predominantly after homorganic nasals, and so the learner unifies them into prenasalized stops. As a side effect, it unifies [ŋ k] and [ŋ x]. In the "broad transcription" version, the voiced stops have a more diverse distribution and a more separable from their nasals. Thus, the fact that [ŋ] occurs only in [ŋ ɡ, ŋ k, ŋ x] is no longer an issue, and it is not unified with these consonants.
