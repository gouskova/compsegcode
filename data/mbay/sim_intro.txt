The Mbay simulation has its own section in the paper.
The corpus comprises 4,046 distinct lexical items and is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/dictionary-of-mbay-mbay-english-english-mbay/oclc/845076325&referer=brief_results">Keegan's (1996) Mbay-English dictionary</a>.  The dictionary was hand-entered into a text file and filtered to exclude proper nouns and loanwords.  Mbay is unusual among the world's languages in that it has a heterorganic prenasalized stop [nɟ], as well as homorganic [mb], [nd], and [ŋg].  For more information on Mbay phonology as well as arguments that nasal-stop sequences function as single segments, see <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/reference-grammar-of-mbay/oclc/634172661&referer=brief_results">Keegan's (1997) grammar</a> of the language.
