<p>The corpus of Polish Child-Directed Speech (CDS) comes from <a href="http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/data/Slavic/Polish/Weist.zip">CHILDES</a>; it ls already fully transcribed. We removed word boundaries and replaced affricate symbols with corresponding stop-fricative sequences, as well as modifying affricate symbols such as the prepalatal [ʤ] with the more accurate retroflex [ɖʐ]. The contrast between stop-retroflex fricative clusters and retroflex affricates was represented
through the place of articulation difference in the first half of the sequence, i.e., <trz> was transcribed as [tʂ]  and <drz> as [dʐ].</p>
