The learner does better on Polish CDS when the data are transcribed narrowly, with different "allophones" of the first halves of affricates for each place of articulation. The learner still fails to identify [ɖʐ] and [dz], which are well below the threshold. The affricate [ts] is just short of the threshold. This confirms that the voiced part of the affricate inventory is a challenge whether the learner is exposed to token or type frequencies.
