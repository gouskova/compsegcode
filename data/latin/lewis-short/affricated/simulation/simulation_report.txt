The new feature file is well-formed. all the segments can be uniquely identified.

Found complex segments on iteration 1:
d z	3.6787301614945473
t ʃ	1.5574459792029804
d ʒ	1.4748579484685562

Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


d  has a subset of the features of dz

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.

Wrote modified learning data to /iteration1/LearningData.txt

The following segments are in the feature file but are not in the data file, and will be removed from feature file:
ʃ ʒ
