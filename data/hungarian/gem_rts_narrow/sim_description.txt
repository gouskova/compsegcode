The simulation run on roots finds the less controversial affricates of Hungarian, [ts] and [tʃ], even without resorting to narrow transcription of the latter. The more controversial affricate [dʒ] just misses the threshold on the 2nd iteration. See Siptár and Törkenczy's discussion in their section 4.1.4, where they also weigh the arguments for [dz] (nowhere near the threshold for unification in any of our simulatoins for the language).
