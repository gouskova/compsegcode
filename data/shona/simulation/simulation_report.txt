Checking learner-generated feature file...

The new feature file does not allow certain segments to be distinguished from each other:


k  has a subset of the features of kw
b  has a subset of the features of bw
b  has a subset of the features of bʋ
g  has a subset of the features of gw
ɦ  has a subset of the features of ɦw
bw  has a subset of the features of bʋ
ɲdʒ  has a subset of the features of mbʒ

Warning: some of the segments can no longer be defined using combinations of existing features (e.g.: "k" [+dorsal], "kp" [+dorsal, +labial]. No constraint can refer to just "k" without also referring to [kp]). You will have to fix this by hand later by editing your final feature file yourself.
