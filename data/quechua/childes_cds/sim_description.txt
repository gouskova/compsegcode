This simulation comes close to finding the target inventory [tʃ, tʃ', tʃʰ]--the learner finds the plain and ejective affricates, but not the aspirated one. It is clear from the inseparability measures that this dataset raises the same issues as the morphologically complex word corpus; once the two affricates are unified, the runner-up clusters are those that are frequent in common suffixes, and [tʃʰ] is not a candidate for unification. It trails [s q], [j p], [j tʃ], [n t], and
others. So, unless this particular example of child-directed speech is atypical of Quechua, it really looks as though roots and morphemes are the right source of distributions for finding affricates.
